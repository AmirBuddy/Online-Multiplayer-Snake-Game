# Real Time TCP Based Server-Client Game system

You can import a game instance of your own inisde server folder, tweak the server a little to accommodate for the game (in the future I make it so much easier to do this), and the client job is simple as it is, get's direct input from user and sends to the server to apply to the system and at the same time it is receiving data to know what to do.

first run the server:

```
cd server
python3 server.py
```

then run the client:

```
cd client
python3 client.py
```
